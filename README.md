# Loading-Screen
This is an HTML and CSS code for a loading screen.

The loading screen consists of three circles and the word "Loading" in the center. The circles are animated and rotate around the center of the screen.

The HTML code creates a basic structure of the web page, including the head and body tags. The head section includes metadata about the web page, such as the title, character set, and viewport. The body section contains the content of the web page.

The CSS code defines the styles for the loading screen. It sets the background color, font family, and size of the text. It also defines the styles for the circles, including the size, border radius, and colors. The circles are positioned absolutely on the screen and animated using keyframe animations. The word "Loading" is styled with an animation that makes it flicker.

Overall, this code creates an attractive and functional loading screen that can be used on a website or application to inform users that content is loading.
